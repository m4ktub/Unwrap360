General Roadmap towards 1.0
===========================

Here are presented the features the program must have before being labeled 
with the major version 1.0. It also attempts to divide those features through
out all the minor versions.

Version 1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~

 * Image Unwrapping
   [x] Unwrap 360 degree images into rectangular images of several sizes.
   [x] Allow the usual interpolations: neirest neighbor, bilinear, and bicubic.
   [ ] Suport equirectangular image output.
   [x] Save resulting image.
 * Settings
   [x] Vertical FOV
   [x] Final image size
   [x] Scaling algorithm
   [x] Save settings between invocations.
   [ ] Configure color to fill blank spots in equirectangular outputs.
 * Video Unwraping
   [ ] Support 360 vídeos and unwrap frame by frame into a final rectangular 
	video.
   [ ] Allow generating equirectangular videos.
 * Viewer
   [ ] Viewer of unwrapped images.
