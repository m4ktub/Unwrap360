Unwrap 360
==========

This simple application intends to be an on-the-road helper for transforming
360 degree images, taken with some sort of omnidirectional mirror, into 
rectangular images that can be view with 360 degree image viewers.

It currently does the work it is intended to do but:
 * it isn't very performant.
 * it is a big chunk of UI with some unwrapping logic so it's not very
   portable to other form factors although it is usable.
 * the generated images have mostly been tested with pan0.net
